                    <h4>What is Harry Potter?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Harry Potter series was written by J.K. Rowling, with the first book being released in 1997.
                        Since
                        then, the
                        series has grown to a total of <strong>seven</strong> books. There are a plethora of
                        mythological
                        elements
                        weaved into the series, from centaurs to trolls to dementors. The books have also morphed into a
                        movie series,
                        only broadening it's range of age appeal.

                    <h4>About the Author</h4>
                    <p>
                        J.K. Rowling is a British author and philanthropist, widely known for her authorship of the
                        Harry
                        Potter series.
                        She grew up a bookworm and wanted to be a writer from an early age, and went on to study at
                        Exeter
                        University. Fun fact -
                        she came up with the idea of Harry Potter in 1990 while sitting on a delayed train from
                        Manchester
                        to London Kingâ€™s Cross. Click on her picture to learn more!

                    <p>
                        <em>Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth.
                            They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay
                            and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air
                            around them...</em> - Professor Lupin, Prizoner of Azkaban

                    <p>Centaurs are magical creatures whose head, torso, and arms were human-like and
                        joined to a horse's lower body. In the series, they were considered to be their
                        own individual species and not half-breeds. They also were known for being naturally
                        talented in archery, healing magic, divination and astronomy.</p>
